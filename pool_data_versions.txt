   versioning of jsbach input files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   /pool/data/JSBACH/<res>              - latest file versions
   /pool/data/JSBACH/input/<rev>/<res>  - files of revision <rev>

  Included in the versioning are all files read by jsbach at run time, not
  the files needed to generate jsbach initial files.

  svn revisions refer to https://svn.zmaw.de/svn/cosmos/branches/cosmos-landveg
                   or    https://svn.zmaw.de/svn/cosmos/branches/mpiesm-landveg

r0001 - 2014-02-07: copy of current files from pool/data/JSBACH.
                    These files had been used for CMIP5 simulations.

r0002 - 2014-02-07: removal of files that should not be used
                    copied hdstart.nc from echam pool to r0002/HD

r0003 - 2014-02-17: initial files generated with jsbach_init_file.f90 r6843
                    changes:
               - maxmoist (r6635): new correction of maximum soil moisture for
                    runs with dynamic vegetation. T. Stacke and S. Hagemann 
                    generated a wcap array with desert values replaced by semi 
                    desert and shrubs values.
               - maxmoist (r6834): minimum value of initial soil moisture is 
                    50% of maxmoist
               - veg_ratio_max (r6843): extrapolated to all non-glacier land
                    grid cells. This changed the order of init file variables.

               no new versions of initial files
                  - with 1 layer soil (the 5layer files can be also used for
                    runs with the old bucket scheme.)
                  - for year 1992 based on land_cover_maps by J. Pongratz
                  - for coupled setups with the ocean grid TP10
                  - with 4, 8 or 12 tiles

r0004 - 2014-04-25: initial files generated with jsbach_init_file.f90 r7052
                    changes:
               - fractional lake mask included (needed with HD model since r7052)
               - nlct as global attribute (r6983)
        2014-06-05: added initial files suitable for stand-alone jsbach 
                    simulations with CRUNCEP forcing (without Antarctica)
        2014-07-04: added initial files for new jsbach on T63GR15 and r2b4 icon
                    grids (??_land_*_1976.nc)
        2014-07-04: added input files needed for jsbach runs with spitfire

r0005 - 2014-10-14: initial files generated with jsbach_init_file.f90 r7149
                    changes:
               - attribute 'axis=Z' for soillev dimension (r7149)
               - svn URL and revision of jsbach_init_file.f90 in history 
                    attribute of jsbach initial files (r7102)
               - again removed jsbach initial files for ICON
               no change in results

r0006 - 2015-02-27: jsbach_init_file.f90 unchanged (r7149)
               - added New Hampshire transitions and harvest files for the 
                 years 1700 to 1850 (T31, T63, T127).
               - added jsbach initial files for year 1700
               - Change of 1850 transitions from zero transitions to real 
                    transitions. Runscripts need to be adapted to use  
                    no_transitions-file in the first years of a simulation

r0007 - 2015-04-15: jsbach_init_file.f90 unchanged (r7149)
               - update of HD parameter file hdpara.nc (based on hdpara_vs1_9.nc
                 by Stefan Hagemann): hdpara.nc now includes longitude and
                 latitude indices for routing via index arrays.
                 The formerly used direction array and the land sea mask
                 is slightly changed, too. This changes results!
        2016-02-24: added jsbach4 initial files for CRUENCEP forcing
        2016-08-30: New directory for historical LUH2 data
        2016-10-06: added CMIP6 Ndeposition files in T63 and T31

r0008 - 2017-02-03: initial files generated with jsbach_init_file.f90 r8974
 	            T127 and T255 only - used for MiKlip and PRIMAVERA
                    changes:
	       - usage of LUH2v2h data for cover_type and cover_fract
	       - application of the pasture rule

r0009 - 2017-03-29: initial files generated with jsbach_init_file.f90 r9011
                    changes:
	       - usage of LUH2v2h data for cover_type and cover_fract
	         As LUH2-states are scaled with veg_ratio_max, jsbach-initial-
	         files and LU-transitions are different for runs with and
		 without dynamic vegetation.
	       - land use maps corresponding to LUH2v2h data
	       - application of the pasture rule
	       - no-dynveg initial files for T127 and T255 are physically
	         identical to r0008, but global attributes and file names sligtly
		 changed
               - contrast to previous revisions for runs without dynamic
	         vegetation you need initial files and transitions with tag
	         'no-dynveg', while for runs with dynamic vegetation tag 'dynveg'
	         is needed.

r0010 - 2017-09-13: initial files generated with jsbach_init_file.f90 r9230
               - scaling of LUH2v2h states changed, to be more independant of
                 the land sea mask, to work with various ocean model grids.
                 This affects jsbach initial files, land_use_maps and 
                 New_Hampshire_LCC land use transitions.
               - new initial files for T127TP6M and T255TP6M
